				"talk-type": "panel",
				"date": "2010-09-13",
				"talk-description": "Parallelism and Education: Rough Waters in a Sea of Change\nSeptember 13, 2010\nOne measure of the quality of education might well be how soon you find yourself employed once you're out of school. But the problem the past few years hasn't been in the quality of education, rather in the demands of the job market.\nIn other words, employers increasingly have demands that students can't meet -- and there's no better example of this than with parallelization. The solution? Schools need to go parallel just as much as industry, at least according to the panel \"Parallelism and Education: Navigating through a Sea of Cores\" at the Intel Developer Forum.\nModerated by Georgia Tech's Matthew Wolf, the panel included a mix of industry and academia that included Daniel Ernst of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Clair, Adobe's Kevin Goldsmith , Intel's Michael McCool, Thomas Murphy from Contra Costa College, and Ryan Newton from Intel.\nWolf kicked off the session by pointing out the challenges educators face when it comes to parallel programming:\nWhat does the move to a many core platform mean to education in general, and the Computer Science curriculum in particular?\nIn the face of ubiquitous parallel systems, what CS core topics need to change?\nWhat are the tools, languages, models and patterns that will allow academia to take advantage of this new platform?\nHow can Industry help?\nWhat skills will hiring managers be demanding?\nAdobe's Goldsmith is one such hiring manager who quickly pointed out that parallel programming is no longer considered a \"special\" skill, at least at Adobe where virtually all software created these days involves multithreading. Consequently, if job applicants can't demonstrate some knowledge of parallel programming, they likely won't make it to the second interview. \"We look for people with parallel skills,\" said Goldsmith. From his outside-of-academia perspective, Goldsmith believes that parallelism needs to be integrated into the whole computer science curriculum, not simply a \"parallel\" class here or there.\nMatthew Wolf's Parallelism and Education: Navigating through a Sea of Cores panel discussion at IDF2010\nFrom inside academia, Dan Ernst concurred, explaining students don't need to be able to write highly optimized code, but they do need to be able to write \"forward scaling code.\"\nMichael McCool, who joined Intel when the company acquired RapidMind which McCool co-founded, acknowledged that one of the problems for students is that parallelism does make it more difficult to write correct code that performs well. To circumvent this problem, said McCool, curriculums need to emphaize stuctured design patterns, such as those McCool discusses in Structured Patterns: An Overview. Doing so is the first step students can take to become developers who efficiently create scalable and reliable parallel applications.\nUnderstanding parallel algorithms and patterns were at the top of Tom Murphy's list too, while Ryan Newton pointed out that \"technology will change, but paradigms -- like parallelism -- will have lasting power. Mathew Wolf closed in agreement, urging educators not to teach specific technologies, but teach to put technology in context.\nhttp://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/parallelism-and-education-rough-waters-i/228800478",

				"talk": "Parallel Education Status Check – Which Programming Approaches Make the Cut for Parallelism in Undergraduate Education?",
				"talk-type": "panel",
				"date": "2011-09-15",
				"talk-description": "As a hiring manager building teams working on modern computer software; I’ve often been disappointed in the lack of a proper foundation in parallel algorithms and architectures being taught in current Computer Science curricula. To that end, I’ve been working with a group called the Educational Alliance for a Parallel Future that aims to improve Computer Science curricula in this critical area. The EAPF is once again convening a panel of educators and industry representatives to talk about this important issue and once again I am delighted to participate.\nThe panel is entitled: Parallel Education Status Check – Which Programming Approaches Make the Cut for Parallelism in Undergraduate Education? Unlike previous iterations of this panel where we spoke in generalities, this time we’ll be diving a bit deeper into specific technologies that we think are good starting places for educators to introduce to their students.\nHere is an excerpt of the abstract:\nThe industry and research communities face increasing workforce preparedness challenges in parallel (and distributed) computing, due to today’s ubiquitous multi-/many-core and cloud computing. Underlying the excitement over technical details of the newest platforms is one of the thorniest questions facing educators and practitioners — What languages, libraries, or programming models are best suited to make use of current and future innovations? This panel will confront this conundrum directly through discussions with technical managers and academics from different perspectives. The session is convened by the Educational Alliance for a Parallel Future (EAPF), an organization with wide-ranging industry/academia/research membership, including Intel, ACM, AMD, and other prominent technology corporations.\nThe panel will be presented on September 15th, 2011 at 10:15am as part of the Intel Developer Forum 2011 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, California. There are free passes for interested educators. Register now for a free IDF day pass using promo code DCPACN1.\nMy specific take has always been that I am not as interested in grounding in a specific parallelism library or abstraction. The pace of change in this area has only increased over the last few years with the rise of multi-core, GPGPU, HPC and heterogenous computing. Techniques and libraries have arisen, gained adoption, and fallen out of favor one after another.\nA developer who only understands how algorithms can be mapped to OpenMP-style libraries is not as useful once the team moves to Grand Central Dispatch or OpenCL. A grounding in traditional task-level parallelism as well as data-parallelism techniques is a starting point. It is important not only to understand what each of them are but the different types of problems that they are each applicable to.\nHigher level abstractions like OpenMP are good for introductory courses. However, it is important to understand fully how high-level abstractions map to lower level implementations and even the hardware itself. Understanding the hardware your software runs on is critical to find the best performance for your code. It is also critical to understanding why one particular higher level library might work better than another for a particular task on specific hardware.\nOnce you understand things like hyperthreading, pThreads, locking mechanisms, and why OpenCL or CUDA maps really well to specific problems, but not to others, then you can return to using higher level abstractions that let you focus on your algorithm and not the details.\nIf I was a Dean of Computer Science somewhere, I’d look to creating a curriculum where parallel programming using higher-level abstractions was part of the introductory courses using something like C++11, OpenMP or TBB. Mid-level requirements would include some computer architecture instruction. Specifically, how computer architecture maps to the software that runs on top of it. This may also include some lower level instruction in things like pThreads, Race conditions, lock-free programming or even GPU or heterogenous programming techniques using OpenCL. In later courses focused more on software engineering, specific areas like graphics, or larger projects: I’d encourage the students to use whichever tools they found most appropriate to the tasks at hand. This might even include very high level proprietary abstractions like DirectCompute or C++AMP as long as the students could make the tradeoffs intelligently because of their understanding of the area from previous courses.\nGiven that the panel consists of representatives from Intel, AMD, Microsoft, Georgia Tech as well as myself, I’m expecting this to be a very spirited conversation. I hope to see you there.",

At Spotify, we are focused not only on continuously improving our own product, but also our practices and culture. This focus on how we work has allowed us to move quickly and adapt to the continuous change in our highly-competitive market, even as the company has grown several hundred percent over the last few years. In this talk, I’ll discuss why spending time on your culture is critical to your success and I’ll show how we’ve put this into practice.",

				"original-talk-description": "Continuous improvement is the goal for agile teams. We strive for it.\nWhat does it look like when we create a continuous improvement beyond our agile teams and bring it to the larger organization: the company level?\nKevin Goldsmith was leaving Spotify, a company that had a built an amazing continuous improvement culture. He saw the benefits that it brought, first hand. When he joined Avvo as its new CTO, his primary goal was to help Avvo create that culture for itself.\nIn this talk, Kevin shows what Avvo has done to build a foundation for a continuous improvement culture: frameworks, organizational and processes that support and empower individuals and groups to own and drive improvements to make themselves more efficient and the company a better place to work.\nThe ideas presented will inspire cultural and organizational changes that you can make to bring continuous improvement to your institutions.",
				"talk-description": "<p>A culture of continuous improvement is a culture where you are always open to improving how you build and deliver. You don't accept the status quo; you choose how to work and feel empowered to change it if it no longer makes sense. It is a people-first culture.</p><p>Having had the benefit of a culture like this at the last place I worked, when I started at my current company, I wanted to see if I could create a continuous improvement culture there, too. It took some effort, and we learned some painful lessons along the way, but we did make significant improvements to how our teams operated and how the engineering organization functioned.</p><p>As a result of these changes, our teams are able to execute at a much higher level, and the morale of the organization improved significantly. In short, we get a lot more stuff done, and we are happier doing it.</p><p>To get there, we had to change some of our frameworks, structures, and processes, or adopt new ones.</p><p>Here are some of the frameworks we created that could be helpful for any company:</p><ul><li><b>WIGs and sWIGs:</b> A way to align the company around a common mid-term strategy and shorter-term tactical deliveries in a way that preserves team autonomy and agile delivery. WIG stands for “wildly important goal,” and sWIG means “sub-wildly important goal.” Our WIGs clarify the midterm strategy for the company, and the sWIGs clarify the shorter-term tactics we are using to achieve that strategy</li><li><b>DUHBs:</b> A data-driven decision-making framework that allows individuals in the company to craft a clear, data-based argument for a making a change. DUHB stands for data, understanding, hypotheses, and bets, which describes the linear process of solving a problem</li><li><b>Journey teams:</b> An autonomous team model that gives teams more direct control over how they work, aligned with customer journeys</li><li><b>RFCs:</b> A mechanism that allows anyone in the organization to drive large-scale change inclusively. It is a document and a process that uses the “request for comment” structure from standards groups as a basis</li><li><b>Retrospectives everywhere:</b> A cultural shift in how we think about examining our organizational strengths and weaknesses when it comes to executing projects</li></ul><p>Each framework builds upon the others. By making the priorities and goals of the company clear, people have the context to make good decisions. With a common data-driven process for vetting ideas, people have a good, structured way to propose changes. With autonomous teams, we can test new ideas locally and let the best practices emerge organically. With an inclusive mechanism for proposing larger-scale changes, the organization can participate in the process instead of having it pushed down from leadership. Finally, with a practice of retrospectives at all levels, the organization can learn from successes and mistakes made in any of the other components.</p><p>These frameworks created an environment that was not only adaptable and nimble but also one where the members of the organization were empowered to make changes and were given tools to make advocating for change easier.</p><p>The organization was ready for change and wanted to improve. People initially embraced the changes, but as they had to adapt to multiple changes happening in series the \"troughs of sorrow\" deepened and deepened. We overspent our change budget and had to adapt how we proceeded. It was a valuable lesson for experienced change agents.</p><p>In this talk, I share the approach we used to create a larger change building on incremental smaller changes, the changes themselves and the lessons learned from our rollout.</p>",

Companies claim to do agile, but just use the words without understanding what they mean. Developers join companies and find out that their previous experience doing agile development was way better or way worse than their current company.\nIn this talk, I go through my 17+ years of agile development, using XP, Scrum, Kanban, Rational, and other techniques with large organizations, small startups, co-located teams and distributed teams to talk about why companies aspire to agile and why they often come nowhere close.",

As we look to close these gaps, we in the tech sector find ourselves experiencing the perfect storm of economic challenges:\n-- Hiring need is out-pacing University output\n-- Socio-economic disparity is growing, driving more people to less industry desired degrees and secondary or tertiary education sources.\n-- Industry operating culture is under attack as diversity continue to decline, and we fail to represent the diverse marketplace that we serve.\n\nThis is why Apprenti (a program from Seattle-based nonprofit Washington Technology Industry Association) partnered with Industry and the U.S. Department of Labor to create a registered tech apprenticeship program. The program attracts diverse tech talent, provides training and a pathway to become successful in tech roles without regard for experience or education, as well as paid on-the-job training experience with top companies across the U.S.\n\nCome hear how companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Accenture and Avvo have adopted the tech apprenticeship model, are closing their diversity and talent gaps, and are hiring top talent from underrepresented groups.",

When I started in the industry, working at companies like Microsoft, we would bet many person-years of development and many millions of dollars into the development of products that would sometimes be hits and sometimes be total duds. We were building blind. This blindness was partly due to our waterfall processes, but also to how software distribution and marketing worked then. A flop for a smaller company could mean the end of the line. The cost of failure was incredibly high. Over the years, we learned how to take some of that risk out by switching to agile software development and now Lean. Working this way we can learn quicker, and take smaller risks. However, there are other things we can do in how we architect our software or roll it out that can also reduce the technical and product risk and help us fail smarter and learn faster. In this keynote, I speak about my experiences building waterfall products at Microsoft, building agile and lean at Adobe, Spotify, and Avvo; and I give real architectural, cultural and organizational tools you can use to make your projects and company more failure safe.",

The much-publicized vote is scheduled for December 14 with what is expected to be a partisan 3-2 approval of the order along party lines. If approved, the order will reverse the utility-style (\"Title II\") regulation of mobile and broadband internet access providers, as well as removing the current prohibitions on blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and general discrimination of Internet access traffic.\nThe order will also return jurisdiction over broadband internet practices to the Federal Trade Commission and pre-empt state and local regulations that might attempt to restore the Obama era policies. This controversial decision will have a major impact on the future of the Internet, with strong reactions from the information industry, consumers, and lawmakers certain to follow.\nWe're pleased that, in anticipation of the vote, Law Seminars International has assembled a diverse panel of experts and scheduled an in depth analysis, via webcast, for the next day. We hope you will be able to join us via the web or by phone. Replays also will be available.

We work Agile because we have had great experiences and success working this way.\nOur experience is not common!\nMost \"Agile Transformations\" fail. Many (if not most) Agile teams have poor Agile practices. People new to Agile struggle through these failed transformations or poor practices and get a wrong impression of Agile, because they have never seen it done well! Poor experience with Agile leads to the many myths and fallacies that developers repeat to each other or post on social media.\nWhat can a dedicated Agilist do to inspire their teams to embrace Agile or work on improving their Agile processes?\nTwo years ago, I came to ABE to talk about the culture of continuous improvement that we were building at Avvo. It turns out that one of the biggest challenges we faced was explaining what our vision was, where we were going.\nI will return for this years' ABE to talk about what a high-performing Agile company looks like, how to create and explain a vision for your teams and I will share the painful lessons we learned at Avvo as we worked on our evolution. I will also share the model I use to help with an Agile cultural transformation.",

				"talk-description": "Drawing on real-life examples from Avvo, Spotify, Adobe and Microsoft, Kevin Goldsmith explores why you should consider changing your organization to improve your architecture and discusses the successes and failures he’s seen around the interplay of organizational models and software architectures. Kevin often visits companies, where he hears about how they struggle to break up monolithic applications or move to a continuous deployment pipeline. Oftentimes, the organizational structure is clearly making their problems harder but is seen as something that can’t be changed. Kevin relates his own journey to a more experimental organizational style. As a developer at Microsoft, Kevin worked in a rigid hierarchy organized around functional areas. The communication flows within the organization dictated the way it structured its libraries and dependencies. This is the essence of Conway’s law. In this case, the company hierarchy and the architecture it produced was often suboptimal for the problem Kevin and his team were solving, but it was the architectural path of least resistance. When Kevin moved to Adobe and became a senior manager, he started to build his organization in the traditional way. Adobe wanted to create a more fluid and agile architecture for its products, but the company struggled to realize these goals because it was it was too hard to work across teams and reporting lines. The company finally started to make some progress as the organization became more fluid and loosely coupled. Kevin then went to Spotify, which had realized this problem early on and restructured its organization in a way that supported the architectural model that it wanted to build. As a vice president of engineering, Kevin was able to see firsthand how the organizational model simplified the architectural challenges that other companies struggled with while also introducing difficulties that other companies were easily able to overcome. Today, Kevin is the CTO at Avvo. When he joined, the company had the same organization and architectural challenges as many other startups, but rather than attack them only from an architectural angle, Avvo is experimenting with architecture and organization together to improve its legacy systems and help build new ones faster and with higher quality.",

Agile is a culture, a mindset and a structure for improving the velocity of innovation and providing real business value to customers. To gain the most benefit from Agile it must be considered as part of a more extensive system that incorporates organizational structure, software architecture, and company culture.</p><p>This talk considers the interactions between how the work, the software, and the people are organized in high performing agile organizations. Using my own experiences at companies large and small, I will share what I have learned and some best practices I use. These lessons will help you as you improve and scale your Agile teams.</p><p>I will discuss:</p><ul><li>How to structure your organization to remove the bottlenecks in coordination and decision-making that can slow velocity to a crawl</li><li>How to take advantage of modern systems architectures to allow teams to move faster</li><li>Using data to provide accountability for autonomous teams without creating more process</li></ul><p>By the end, you will have concrete examples and ideas that you can bring back to your team to help you improve and scale agile within your organization.</p>",

We work Agile because we have had great experiences and success working this way. Our experience is not common! Most \"Agile Transformations\" fail. Many (if not most) Agile teams have poor Agile practices. People new to Agile struggle through these failed transformations or poor practices and get a wrong impression of Agile, because they have never seen it done well! Poor experience with Agile leads to the many myths and fallacies that developers repeat to each other or post on social media. What can a dedicated Agilist do to inspire their teams to embrace Agile or work on improving their Agile processes? Two years ago, I came to ABE to talk about the culture of continuous improvement that we were building at Avvo. It turns out that one of the biggest challenges we faced was explaining what our vision was, where we were going. I will return for this years' ABE to talk about what a high-performing Agile company looks like, how to create and explain a vision for your teams and I will share the painful lessons we learned at Avvo as we worked on our evolution. I will also share the model I use to help with an Agile cultural transformation.",

				"talk-description": "Drawing on real-life examples from Avvo, Spotify, Adobe and Microsoft, Kevin Goldsmith explores why you should consider changing your organization to improve your architecture and discusses the successes and failures he’s seen around the interplay of organizational models and software architectures. Kevin often visits companies, where he hears about how they struggle to break up monolithic applications or move to a continuous deployment pipeline. Oftentimes, the organizational structure is clearly making their problems harder but is seen as something that can’t be changed. Kevin relates his own journey to a more experimental organizational style. As a developer at Microsoft, Kevin worked in a rigid hierarchy organized around functional areas. The communication flows within the organization dictated the way it structured its libraries and dependencies. This is the essence of Conway’s law. In this case, the company hierarchy and the architecture it produced was often suboptimal for the problem Kevin and his team were solving, but it was the architectural path of least resistance. When Kevin moved to Adobe and became a senior manager, he started to build his organization in the traditional way. Adobe wanted to create a more fluid and agile architecture for its products, but the company struggled to realize these goals because it was it was too hard to work across teams and reporting lines. The company finally started to make some progress as the organization became more fluid and loosely coupled. Kevin then went to Spotify, which had realized this problem early on and restructured its organization in a way that supported the architectural model that it wanted to build. As a vice president of engineering, Kevin was able to see firsthand how the organizational model simplified the architectural challenges that other companies struggled with while also introducing difficulties that other companies were easily able to overcome. When Kevin joined Avvo as its CTO, the company had the same organization and architectural challenges as many other startups, but rather than attack them only from an architectural angle, Avvo experimented with architecture and organization together to improve its legacy systems and help build new ones faster and with higher quality.",

				"talk-description": "Software development has been evolving. When I started in the industry, working at companies like Microsoft, we would bet many person-years of development and many millions of dollars into the development of products that would sometimes be hits and sometimes be total duds. We were building blind. This blindness was partly due to our waterfall processes, but also to how software distribution and marketing worked then. A flop for a smaller company could mean the end of the line. The cost of failure was incredibly high. Over the years, we learned how to take some of that risk out by switching to agile software development and now Lean. Working this way we can learn quicker, and take smaller risks. However, there are other things we can do in how we architect our software or roll it out that can also reduce the technical and product risk and help us fail smarter and learn faster. In this keynote, I speak about my experiences building waterfall products at Microsoft, building agile and lean at Onfido, Adobe, Spotify, and Avvo; and I give real architectural, cultural, and organizational tools you can use to make your projects and company more failure safe.",

You go from working for a manager who has much insight into your daily work to one who primarily delegates some work and relies on your ability to self-manage and self-organize. You may also work for someone who comes from a non-technical background who cannot give you good feedback on your decisions.</p><p>To continue to grow and improve as senior leaders, we must rely on ourselves to objectively understand our performance, find areas for improvement, and then create growth plans.</p><p>I have found and developed several self-reflection and planning techniques over the years. These techniques let me self-identify my areas of improvement and create plans and goals around my development.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss how you can create a personalized system for yourself, a system that can use for your continued development as a senior leader.</p>",
