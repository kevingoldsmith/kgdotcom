Maybe next time we'll have to book a 2-hour slot haha</p><p>Anyway, the most interesting takeaway for me was when Kevin explained about how a start-up of 5 people might not benefit from having a CTO with 25 years of experience whos managed teams of 100+ people. There's seemingly a huge amount of diversity in skill sets from one CTO to another and the job function changes wildly depending on the size of the company, headcount, the business needs etc.</p>"
