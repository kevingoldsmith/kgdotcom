		"description": "Building psychological safety in your teams is critical if you want them to perform at their best. The challenge is how to develop and encourage the trust and collaboration and to make sure that all voices are heard. \nThe agile community has developed facilitation exercises and tools that make conversations more democratic and inclusive. I have used some of these techniques with my teams for years and have found them incredibly valuable. I will teach you some of the agile methods that I use for large and small team meetings, brainstorms, and one-on-ones that encourage all team members to participate. These tools also help make sure that all voices are respected and valued."

		"description": "A great team is a like a great dish, balanced flavors, tastes, textures and smells combine to create something unique and delicious. I've made the mistakes of trying to build unbalanced teams either with poor distributions of experience, bad combinations of temperament, clashing skill sets or lack of diversity. I'll share those mistakes. I'll also share some of the things I did right (either intentionally or unintentionally) to create the teams that have worked very well. I'll provide some things to look out and consider for as you build a team or just expand the one you have."
