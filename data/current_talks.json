		"description": "<p>Many, if not most of us, started as developers. We learned and perfected our craft and were proud of our coding accomplishments. It was what defined us.</p><p>Moving into the Lead role means taking on new responsibilities. Some are technical. Many are not.</p><p>As you progress in leadership, more and more of your responsibilities have less and less to do with coding. Many of us, including me, struggle with giving up coding when it is no longer our primary responsibility. Adapting to this new reality is one of the biggest challenges that I have seen leads face as they move into managing larger teams.</p><p>When is it time to make coding your hobby instead of your job? How do you do it? Where do you find that quick hit of dopamine that is gone when you can't mark a bug as fixed or get rid of that compilation error?</p><p>This talk is all about embracing the joys and challenges of people leadership while staying credible as a technical professional, and what it means to be a leader in a technical organization. The talk discusses how you can remain a technical resource for your team, even when you aren't deep in the code.</p><p>This talk will give you a potential path to follow in your development. It will make you more confident about your new technical leadership career, even if you are still a coding lead.</p>"

		"talk":"Using Agile Techniques to Build a More Inclusive Team",
		"description": "Building psychological safety in your teams is critical if you want them to perform at their best. The challenge is how to develop and encourage the trust and collaboration and to make sure that all voices are heard. \nThe agile community has developed facilitation exercises and tools that make conversations more democratic and inclusive. I have used some of these techniques with my teams for years and have found them incredibly valuable. I will teach you some of the agile methods that I use for large and small team meetings, brainstorms, and one-on-ones that encourage all team members to participate. These tools also help make sure that all voices are respected and valued."

		"talk": "Architecture and Organization",
		"description": "Over 50 years ago Melvin Conway wrote an article identifying a correspondence between the structure of our organizations and the structure of the software we produce. We still talk about Conway's Law today because of the fundamental truth of that observation. This talk goes beyond that article to examine why this happens, and how you can take advantage of it to make better software."
